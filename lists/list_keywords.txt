>> Abomination:::
"This gets +Attack equal to the printed Attack of the Hero in the HQ space under this Villains's city space."
• "Ultimate Abomination" = "This gets +Attack equal to the total printed Attack of all the Heroes in the HQ".
• "@ Abomination" = "This gets +Attack equal to the printed Attack of the Hero in the HQ space under @".
• "Highest Abomination" = "This gets +Attack equal to the highest printed Attack on any single card in the HQ.
• "Double Abomination" = Double the Attack Bonus.
• Divided Cards in the HQ add both their Attack numbers together.
///

>> Adapt:::
"Shuffle the Mastermind Tactics and randomly put one on top, face up."
• You might randomly pick the same Tactic that was previously on top, or it might be a different Tactic.
///

>> Artifact:::
When you gain an Artifact, put it in your discard pile like any other Hero card.
When you play that Artifact, yo “control” it.
You may use its effects, usually once on each of your turns.
At the end of your turn, when you discard all the cards you played that turn, the Artifacts you control stay in. 
• You can use an Artifact in the 1st turn you play it.
• You can’t use your Artifacts’ “once per turn” abilities during other players’ turns.
• If a card effect during any player’s turn asks you to “Reveal a Hero,” you may reveal a Hero Artifact you control.
Card effects that say “your Heroes” or “Heroes you have” include Hero Artifacts you control as well. 
• However, you only “played” an Artifact on the turn you put it out.
It only activates Superpower Abilities on the turn you play the Artifact, not every turn of the game.
Likewise, card effects that count “each Hero you played this turn” only count an Artifact if you played it this turn. 
• You don’t have to use an Artifact’s abilities on a turn if you don’t want to. 
• If a card effect would let you “copy” an Artifact card, then you can use that Artifact’s “Once per turn” ability once, and there is no other effect.
///

>> Berserk:::
“Discard the top card of your deck. You get +A equal to the discarded card's printed Attack”.
///

>> Bribe:::
You can fight villains with “Bribe” by spending any combination of Attack and/or Recruit points.
///

>> Cheering Crowds:::
"You may play this card twice in a row if you return a Bystander from your Victory Pile to the bottom of the Bystander Stack."
• Essentially you play the card itself, and then you play a bonus copy of that card.
• If you use Cheering Crowds to play a Versatile card twice, you could get Recruit with one play and get Attack with the other play, or choose the same for both.
///

>> Clone Heroes:::
"You may gain another copy of this card from the HQ. If there are none in the HQ, you may gain a copy from the Hero Deck and shuffle it."
• If you Clone a S.H.I.E.L.D. Officer or Sidekick, search and shuffle that stack instead.
• If you Clone "When Recruited", use the Clone ability right after you put the recruited Hero in your discard pile, after you refill its HQ space.
• Use a “When Recruited” ability only when you recruit a Hero, not when an ability causes you to “gain” a Hero or “put it in your hand.”
///

>> Clone Villains:::
"Search the Villain Deck for a copy of this Villain, and it enter the city, ignoring any further Clone effects. Shuffle that deck."
///

>> @ Conqueror #:::
“This gets +# A while any Villain is on the @”.
///

>> Contest of Champions @:::
• Each player in turn reveals a single card, either from their hand, or that they played this turn, or the top card of their deck.
That player announces their “Contest Score,” which is that card’s printed cost, doubled if it’s a @ card.
• After all players have announced their Contest Score, then Evil tries to win the contest.
Reveal the top two cards of the Hero Deck, and Evil uses whichever card gives the highest Contest Score.
This is the card’s printed cost, doubled if it’s a @ card.
Then put both those cards on the bottom of the Hero Deck.
• Whichever score is highest (or tied for highest) “wins” the contest. Everyone else “loses”.
• A few cards reveal a Hero card and use its colors for a contest.
This can create contests that are multicolor, such as “Contest of Champions @, $ .”
In this case, any card that includes either @ or $ will match the contest and have its score doubled.
(A card that’s both @ and $ won’t be quadrupled.)
///

>> Coordinate:::
• During another player's turn, you can discard a Coordinate card from your hand and then draw a new card to replace it.
• That player can now play a copy of that card. A copy counts as playing the exact same card including its A, R, special abilities, and Hero
Class symbol.
• You can only Coordinate one card to each player on their turn.
However, multiple players can each Coordinate one card to the player whose turn it is.
• When you offer to Coordinate a card, the other player can decline.
If so, you don't discard that card and that player doesn't play a copy of it.
• If you are playing solo, once per turn, you may discard a card with Coordinate to draw a card.
///

>> Cosmic Threat @:::
“Once per turn, for each @ card you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 for one fight this turn.”
• Cosmic Threat @, $, % means: "Once per turn, choose @, $ or %. For each card of that color you reveal, this Enemy gets -3 Attack for one fight this turn."
///

>> Cross-Dimensional @ Rampage:::
“Each player reveals one of their @ Heroes or a @ card in their Victory Pile or gains a Wound”.
///

>> Danger Sense #:::
"Reveal the top # cards of the Villain Deck. You get +1A for each Villain you revealed. Put all the cards back on top in any order."
///

>> Danger Sense # (Black Order):::
“Reveal the top # cards of the Villain Deck.
All Black Order Villains in the city and the Mastermind get this turn +1A for each Villain you revealed.
Put all the cards back on top in any order”.
///

>> Dark Memories:::
“This gets +1A for each Hero Class among cards in discard pile”.
///

>> Demonic Bargain:::
"The chosen player discards the top card of their deck to see if they are corrupted by power.
If that discarded card costs 1 or more, that player is too powerful and arrogant to resist temptation and gains a Wound."
• If that discarded card costs 0, then that player has been humble enough to resist corruption.
• Whether that player gained a Wound or not, they then gain the Demonic Bargain’s listed benefit (or downside).
• A player chosen to make a Demonic Bargain cannot decline.
///

>> Digest # / Indigestion:::
• Use this Digest ability only if you have at least # cards in your Victory Pile.
• If you don’t have enough cards in your Victory Pile to use a card’s Digest ability, use its Indigestion ability instead.
• If you have enough cards in your Victory Pile to use Digest, you can’t choose to use Indigestion.
///

>> Divided Cards:::
• If a divided card costs “3” on each side, you pay only 3 Recruit, not 6.
• When you play a Divided Card, you choose which side to play. You ignore the other side, as if it doesn’t exist.
• While a Divided Card is in your hand or the HQ, it counts as all its Hero Classes, Teams and Hero Names.
But once you play it, the card only counts as the side you chose.
• A Divided Card is one card, not two.
So if you have to “discard two cards,” “draw two cards,” or count the number of cards in your hand, a Divided Card only counts as one card.
///

>> Dominate:::
• "Dominate" Hero cards means "Put those Heroes under this enemy. This enemy gets +1A for each Hero it's Dominating".
• When you fight that enemy, put one of those Dominated Heroes into each player's discard pile.
You choose which player gets which Hero, including yourself.
There might not be enough for every player to get one. KO any excess Dominated Heroes.
• If a Villain escapes, any Heroes Dominated by that Villain go to the Escape Pile too.
///

>> Empowered by @:::
“This gets +1A for each @ card in the HQ.”
///

>> Excessive Violence:::
• Once per turn, you can spend one Attack point more than you need to fight an Enemy “using Excessive Violence”.
If you do, you get to use all the Excessive Violence abilites on Cards you’ve already played this turn.
• If you’ve played multiple Heroes (even multiple copies of the same Hero) with the Excessive Violence keyword, they would all trigger at the same time.
You don’t get to save it for later.
• If you fight with Excessive Violence, then draw or play more cards with Excessive Violence abilites later in the turn, it will be too late to use those abilities.
///

>> Fateful Resurrection:::
"Fight: Reveal the top card of the Villain Deck. If it's a Scheme Twist or Master Strike, this Villain reenters the city."
• If a Villain resurrects this way, you still rescue its Bystanders and do its other Fight effects.
• The Villain pushes into the Sewers and does any Ambush abilities as normal.
• If a Mastermind Tactic resurrects this way, shuffle it back into the other face down Tactics.
• If a Villain that has ascended to become a Mastermind resurrects this way, it stays a Mastermind and does not reenter the city.
///

>> Feast:::
"Fight: KO the top card of your deck."
• "Feast on each player." means each player does the "Feast" effect.
///

>> Focus # R > "@":::
"You can pay # Recruit to get @."
• You can use that Focus ability as many times as you want for the rest of the turn, as long as you have the Recruit points available.
• You can use Focus abilities and still use the "Healing" ability on Wounds.
///

>> Fortify @:::
• Put this Enemy on or near the @ place. While it’s there, it has the listed effect.
Any player can fight that Enemy as normal to put it (if it's a Villain) or one of its Tactics (if it's a Mastermind) into their Victory Pile, and to end that Fortify effect if the Enemy is no longer there. 
• If a card would fortify a place, don’t do anything if there’s already a Villain fortifying that place.
///

>> Hidden Witness:::
“This Villain captures # Hidden Witnesses" means the Villain captures the top # cards of the Bystander Stack, face-down, as Hidden Witnesses.
You can't fight a Villain while it has a Hidden Witness.
• During your turn you can pay 2 Recruit to rescue a Hidden Witness any number of times and put it in your Victory Pile.
• Hidden Witnesses still count as Bystanders. When you rescue one, you get any special "When you rescue this Bystander ..." effect written on it.
It stays in your Victory Pile as a normal, face-up Bystander.
• A Villain can have face-up Bystanders and face- down Hidden Witnesses at the same time. You'll need to pay to rescue the face-down Hidden Witnesses.
Then, you can fight the Villain, which will automatically rescue the faceup Bystanders.
• Hidden Witnesses still count as Bystanders. Villains escaping with Hidden Witnesses still make players discard as normal.
• You can pay to rescue Hidden Witnesses even if you're not going to fight that Villain during that turn.
You can also rescue just some of the Hidden Witnesses and leave others for later.
• If a special ability lets you "Defeat a Villain for free," you automatically rescue all the Hidden Witnesses on it without paying Recruit.
///

>> Hydra Level:::
• The Hydra Level is the number of S.H.I.E.L.D. and/or HYDRA cards in the Escape Pile.
• This includes any card with the [S.H.I.E.L.D.] or [HYDRA] team icons, as well as any card with “S.H.I.E.L.D.” or “Hydra” in its card name, Villain Group name, or Mastermind name.
• Some abilities put [S.H.I.E.L.D.] cards directly from S.H.I.E.L.D. Officer Stack into the Escape Pile to increase Hydra Level.
This is not an “escape” unless it’s a Villain escaping from the city, so it won’t KO a Hero of cost 6 or less from the HQ.
///

>> Hyperspeed #:::
“Reveal the top # cards of your deck. You get +1A for each card with an A icon you revealed this way. Discard all those cards”.
///

>> Investigate for @:::
"Look at the top two cards of your deck. Reveal a @ card from among them and draw it.
Put the rest of those cards back on the top and/or bottom of your deck in any order."
(You only get to draw one card even if both cards match the Investigation. If at least one card matches, you must reveal and draw one card.)
///

>> Lightshow:::
“Once per turn, if you played at least two Lightshow cards this turn, you can use a single Lightshow ability from any of those cards. ”
• If you play three, four, or more Lightshow cards you still use only a single Lightshow ability.
///

>> Locations:::
• When a Location is played from the Villain Deck, place it above the nearest city space that does not have a Location.
• Locations do not count as Villains.
• Locations don’t move. Villains don’t push Locations forward. You can have a Villain in a city space that has a Location above it.
• You can fight a Location by spending the listed amount of A, putting it into your Victory Pile, and doing any Fight ability the Location may have.
• If a new Location is played, and every city space already has a Location, then KO the Location with the lowest A to make room.
(If tied, the current player chooses.) This might KO the newly played Location or one of the previous Locations.
• A city space with a Location above it and no Villains still counts as “empty” for abilities like Last Stand.
• Some Masterminds have Tactics that become a Location.
You don’t have to defeat all the Tactic cards that have turned into Locations in the city to defeat a Mastermind.
• Locations don’t usually capture Bystanders, but some card abilities can make them capture Bystanders. Rescue them when you fight that Location.
///

>> Man Out of Time:::
“After you use this card’s abilities, set it aside. At the beginning of your next turn, play this card a second time and then discard it.”
• The card is discarded the second time you play it, so you play the card only twice total. You can’t use Man Out of Time again to play that card for a third turn.
• Play your returning Man Out of Time cards after the “Play a Villain Card” part of your turn and before you start playing out your hand.
• You “played” a Man Out of Time card on both the first turn you played it and the second turn when you replayed it, so it can help activate your Superpower Abilities on both turns.
///

>> Moonlight:::
• Moonlight abilities work only when most of the Heroes in the HQ have odd-numbered costs.
• If there are a tied number of odd and even numbered Heroes in the HQ (because some HQ spaces have been added or destroyed), neither Moonlight nor Sunlight is in effect.
• Only the printed costs matter. Abilities that change the costs of Heroes in the HQ won’t affect Moonlight and Sunlight.
• “Divided Cards” from Civil War and other sets count as just one card for Moonlight/Sunlight.
///

>> Outwit:::
“You can use this Outwit ability only if you reveal Heroes with 3 different costs”.
• You can choose not to, even if you are able.
///

>> Phasing:::
• During your turn, if a card with Phasing is in your hand, you may swap it with the top card of your deck.
• Swapping cards this way isn’t “playing a card” or “drawing a card,” so it doesn’t count for other abilities that trigger on those things.
///

>> Rise of the Living Dead:::
“Each player checks the top card of their Victory Pile. If that card is a Villain with a “Rise of Living Dead” ability, that Villain reenters the city.”
• Mastermind Tactics never return this way.
• If you put a Villain with Bystanders into your Victory Pile, you choose the order.
///

>> Savior:::
“Use this ability if you have at least 3 Bystanders in your Victory Pile.”
• If you defeat a Villain with Bystanders, put those Bystanders into your Victory Pile before checking any Savior ability on that Villain.
• If a Hero Card rescues a Bystander, that Bystander counts towards any Savior ability on that Hero.

///

>> Send Undercover:::
“Put it into your Victory Pile. It’s worth 1VP.”
• If you play a card, and it sends itself Undercover, you still get its R and A.
///

>> Shards:::
Shards can be gained by Players, Villains and Masterminds from the supply.
If a Shard would be gained, but there are none left in the supply, then no Shard is gained, and the game continues.
• Players: You can spend a Shard to get +1A (returning the Shard to the supply).
If you don’t use a Shard immediately, you can keep it for future turns and use it later. You can spend as many Shards as you wish in a single turn.
• Villains: Villains get +1 for each Shard it has. After you defeat a Villain, you take one of its Shards. Return the rest to the supply.
When a Villain escapes, the Mastermind gains one of the Shards on that Villain. Return the rest to the supply.
• Masterminds: Masterminds get +1 for each Shard they have. After you fight a Mastermind, you take one of its Shards. Return the rest to the supply.
Then do the Fight effect on the Mastermind Tactic, which might give the Mastermind additional Shards for future fights.
///

>> Shatter @:::
"Halve @'s current Attack (round up to the nearest whole number)."
This effect lasts until the end of this turn.
• You can shatter the same Villain multiple times, halving their Attack (rounding up) each time.
• “Shatter a Villain” can’t be used on a Mastermind.
• “Shatter the Mastermind,” lasts for one fight against that Mastermind.
• "Shatter a Hero in the HQ" halves their current cost (round up) the same way.
• Technically, the Villain gets - Attack equal to half its current Attack.
///

>> S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance:::
“You must discard a S.H.I.E.L.D. Hero as an additional cost to fight this Villain or Mastermind”
• If a Mastermind has “Double S.H.I.E.L.D. Clearance”, then you must discard two S.H.I.E.L.D. Heroes each time you fight it.
///

>> Size-Changing @:::
“You can recruit / fight this card for 2 less if you played a @ card this turn.”
• You can recruit either side of a divided card with its own Size-Changing discount, but you can’t get both discounts at once.
• Size-Changing: @, $: If you played any @ card this turn, cost is 2 less. If you played any $ card, cost is 2 less. If both, the cost is 4 less.
• Microscopic Size-Changing: @, @, @. You can recruit/fight this card for 2 less for each @ card you played this turn, counting up to three cards.
Microscopic Size-Changing can reduce a card’s cost to zero or even a negative number.
When you recruit / fight a Microscopic Size-Changing hero / villain with a negative cost, you actually gain that many R / A points.
///

>> Smash #:::
"You may discard another card from your hand. If you do, you get +#A."
///

>> Soaring Flight:::
"When you recruit this Hero, set it aside. At the end of this turn, add it to your new hand as an extra card."

“You can use this Spectrum ability only if you have at least 3 classes of Hero”.

>> Striker:::
"This gets +1A for each Master Strike in the KO pile and/or stacked next to the Mastermind."

>> Sunlight:::
• Sunlight abilities work only when most of the Heroes in the HQ have even-numbered costs.
• If there are a tied number of odd and even numbered Heroes in the HQ (because some HQ spaces have been added or destroyed), neither Moonlight nor Sunlight is in effect.
• Only the printed costs matter. Abilities that change the costs of Heroes in the HQ won’t affect Moonlight and Sunlight.
• “Divided Cards” from Civil War and other sets count as just one card for Moonlight/Sunlight.
///

>> Switcheroo #:::
“You may reveal this card from your hand and put it on the bottom of the Hero Deck, instead of playing it.
If you do, you may put a Hero of printed cost # from the HQ into your hand”.
///

>> Symbiote Bonds:::
“Stack this card onto the other Villain, combining them into 1 Villain with both cards’ A and texts.”
• It counts as both cards’ Villain Groups.
• Ignore any effect that would combine more than two Villains in the same city space.
• Once two Villains are bonded, only fighting can break them up.
Other Symbiote Bonds abilites can’t break up a Comibned Villain to attach one of the cards to something else.
• To fight a Combined Villain, you must spend the total A of both. Rescue all their Bystanders.
Then put either one of the Villains into your Victory Pile and do that card’s Fight effect. The other Villain stays. Don’t do its Fight effect.
• Automatically “defeating” a Combined Villain puts just 1 card into your Victory Pile and do that card’s Fight effect.
• If a Combined Villain escapes, it’s only a single escape, but do the Escape abilites of both cards in any order.
In the Escape Pile, they are 2 Unattached Villains again.
///

>> Tactical Formation ##$:::
"You can use this ability only if you have two Heroes that costs # and one Hero that costs $.
• You can count the "Tactical Formation" card itself.
• “Heroes you have” includes Heroes you already played this turn and Heroes in your hand.
///

>> Teleport:::
“Instead of playing this card, you may set it aside. At the end of this turn, add it to your new hand as an extra card.”
///

>> Thrown Artifact:::
• See Artifacts. To "throw" a Thrown Artifact, put it on the bottom of your deck and use its ability.
• You can throw as many Artifacts as you want in a turn. You can only throw during your turn.
• If a card effect would let you "copy" a Thrown Artifact card, use that Artifact's "When you throw this" ability once, and there is no other effect.
(Don't put anything on the bottom of your deck.)
///

>> Transform:::
• When you transform a card into another, you complete all effects on the card you played and get its normal R and A.
• Then remove the transforming card from the game (putting it in the Transformation Pile) and put the newly transformed card into your hand instead (from the Transformation Pile).
You can play the new Transformed card immediately that same turn.
• You still count as having played the transforming card you played and removed from the game.
But if an effect asks you to reveal one of your cards, you can only reveal the new, transformed card, not the old card that you removed from the game.
• Some transforming cards tell you to put the new card on top of your deck or discard pile instead.
///

>> Trap:::
• When a Trap is played from the Villain Deck, it gives you a challenge to complete this turn to avoid the Trap.
If you complete the challenge, put the Trap in your Victory Pile and get its VP. A Trap is not a Villain and doesn't enter the city.
• If you fail to complete the challenge, then at the end of the turn (after you draw a new hand) you must KO the trap and suffer the consequences!
///

>> Versatile #:::
“You get +#R or +#A . You can’t divide it up.
///

>> Villainous Weapon:::
• Villainous Weapons are not Villains.
• When a Villainous Weapon is played from the Villain Deck, the Weapon is captured by the Villain in the city that’s closest to the Villain Deck.
If there are no Villains in the city, then KO the Weapon instead.
• Villainous Weapons add the A bonus printed on them to the Villain holding them.
• An enemy can use any number of Weapons at the same time, getting all of their bonuses.
• When a Villain with Villainous Weapons escapes the city, the Mastermind captures all those Weapons, getting their A bonuses.
• When you fight a Villain or Mastermind holding any number of Weapons, put all those Weapons into your discard pile as Artifacts.
• When you have a Villainous Weapon in your hand, you can play it just like any other Artifact.
• You never get the Weapon’s printed A bonus when you play the Artifact or control it. Only Villains and Masterminds get that A bonus.
You only get the specific Artifact abilities written on the card.
• Villainous Weapons you have captured as Artifacts have 0 cost, have no color or Hero Class, and don’t count as Hero cards or Villain cards.
• If you have gained a Villainous Weapon, and a card effect makes an enemy capture that Weapon again, then it works as a Villainous Weapon again until someone defeats that enemy to reclaim it.
///

>> Waking Nightmare:::
“Discard a non-grey Hero from your hand. If you discard a Hero this way, draw a card.“
///

>> Wall-Crawl:::
"When you recruit this Hero, you may put it on top of your deck."
• When you use Wall-Crawl to put a card on top of your deck, don't use any other abilities on that card until it gets drawn from your deck.
If you "gain" a Hero through some special ability, you can't use Wall-Crawl because you didn't "recruit" that Hero.

You are Worthy if you have a Hero that costs 5 or more.
///

>> Wounded Fury:::
"It gets +1A for each Wound in your discard pile."
///

>> X-Gene @:::
"If you have a @ card in your discard pile, get:"
• You can only use a card's X-Gene ability once, no matter how many matching cards you have in your discard pile.
• Remember: when you play a card during your turn, it stays in front of you until the end of turn.
Then all the cards you played that turn go to the discard pile.
